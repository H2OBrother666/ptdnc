# ptdnc

I try to manipulate DNC (https://deepmind.com/blog/article/differentiable-neural-computers published by Deepmind ).
Deepmind tensorflow version:https://github.com/deepmind/dnc
All modules I write pass test code provided by Deepmind,but still unable to train.I have to start to prepare my master exam,so I can't fix it immediately.
